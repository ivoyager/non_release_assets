# non_release_assets
Contains non-release assets that may be needed for development builds. I, Voyager assets (`ivoyager_assets` directory) are not Git tracked so must be downloaded and added manually.

Download development assets [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/non_release_assets/releases).

Release assets can be found with ivoyager releases [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager/releases).
